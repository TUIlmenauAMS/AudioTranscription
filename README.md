# AudioTranscription
Colab jupyter notebook using txtai for audio transcription in English

This Python jupyter notebbook is a simple implementation of the txtai transcription, as shown e.g. in
https://colab.research.google.com/github/neuml/txtai/blob/master/examples/11_Transcribe_audio_to_text.ipynb
In the meantime, dependencies changed. The necessary modules with the correct dependencies are now in https://pypi.org/, such that they can be easily installed using pip, which is done in this Colab jupyter notebook.

For a transcription, just load the speech audio file into the session storage and copy its link into the corresponding space of the script. After running all, the transcribed text appears at the end as a printout.
